We routinely applied filter criteria to each of the metabolites (based on the blinded ADNI 1 duplicates or ADNI 2/GO triplicates) to allow only the most robust analytes to be included in downstream analysis. Separately for each cohort, we used a coefficient of variation (CV) &lt;30% across plates to filter out metabolites with limited variation and therefore statistical power for analysis.

Consequently, adding agritourism to a farm's operations does not necessarily displace crop and livestock production. In addition, agritourism mainly involves domestic suppliers and consumers; it suffers less than other agricultural commodities from global competition (Veeck, Che, and Veeck 2006) .\\nThe local focus of agritourism can benefi t surrounding communities. Farm visitors who purchase local goods and services (including farm products) stimulate the community's economy 1 In our analysis explaining farmers' involvement in agritourism, we ran variations of the model that included individual dummy variables to represent farms specializing in grain, vegetables, fruits, cattle and calves, and dairy production. None of the resulting coeffi cients (shown with t-values in parentheses) was signifi cant: grains, 0.0047 (0.0114); cattle and calves, -0.047 (-0.192); dairy, -0.127 (-0.187); vegetables, -0.121 (-0.156); fruits, 0.183 (0.332) . These results suggest that agritourism does not signifi cantly displace these crop and livestock operations. (Saxena et al. 2007 ). As agritourism attracts urban dwellers to rural areas, urban tourists, especially teens and young adults, have an opportunity to develop an appreciation for rural people and places through their interactions with rural residents. In addition, agritourism can enhance a \"sense of place\" for local residents, giving them more reasons to stay and invest in their communities.\\nThe magnitude of the local economic impacts of agritourism farms can be gauged by examining data from the 2007 Agricultural Resource Management Survey</td>\n",

ADNI also aims to accurately track progression of the disease and devise tests to measure the effectiveness of potential interventions. Currently, the study involves over 1,000 participants, including people without memory problems, those with MCI, and patients with diagnosed AD. Early diagnosis of AD is key to the development, assessment, and monitoring of new treatments for AD. Approaches to characterize AD progression will help researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness. Further, being able to understand disease progression will increase the safety and efficacy of drug development and potentially decrease the time and cost of clinical trails. The ADNI project is a longitudinal study, where selected subjects are categorized into three BL diagnostic groups: CN, MCI, and AD, repeatedly over a 6-month or 1-year interval. The date when the subjects are scheduled to perform the screening becomes BL after approval and the time point for the follow-up visits is denoted by the duration starting from the BL. We use the notation Month 6 (M6) to denote the time point half year after the first visit. Currently, ADNI has up to Month 48 follow-up data available for some patients.

The prediction analysis carried on in this research therefore did improve somewhat on the current system that was in place (i.e the diagnostic test).

Of note, although the network-wide measures in the analyses above indicated associations with cognition, the voxel-level results demonstrated substantial regional variation in the strength of the correlation between network connectivity at a given voxel and each cognitive domain. These results, presented at a liberal threshold, suggest that relationships with cognition likely occur across multiple regions within a network and are general across cognitive domains, but that there may nonetheless be important regional variability to be explored. In particular, although the SN and DAN had weak or no relationships with cognition when using network-wide metrics (Table 1) , these networks showed evidence of regionally specific relationships with similar magnitude to those observed in the DN and FPCN (Fig. 2) . One feature of the TBR method is that the network templates are not required to be orthogonal to one another, and each voxel will be assigned a value representing its association to every template in the analysis. Because the resulting network connectivity metrics are correlated with each other (Supplementary Table S1 ), it remains possible that the above results represent a general influence of an individual's average connectivity across networks on cognition, rather than a specific relationship between connectivity in a given network and a particular cognitive domain. We therefore examined the correlations between connectivity in each network and each cognitive domain controlling for age, QA metrics, and connectivity in each of the other three networks.

The distributions of hippocampus volumes of different groups are illustrated in Fig. 2 . These plots indicated that AD patients and NC elderly could be roughly separated based on their hippocampus volumes. However, the hippocampus volumes of MCI individuals scatter inbetween the AD group and NC group, demonstrating the complexity of distinguishing between the 4 groups based on the hippocampus volume only. In fact, that might be impossible.\\nTwo experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the Deep Ordinal Ranking model. We first performed a binary classification task for distinguishing the AD patients from the NC individuals using the shape representation, radiomics representation, and deep representation respectively with a two-fold purpose. On one hand, we would like to check the power of hippocampus based representation for the AD diagnosis, on the other hand, we would like to investigate if the deep representation learned based on the deep CNNs is more discriminative for the prediction task. We then performed the 4-category prediction based on the 3 kinds of hippocampus representation under regular multi-category classification and ordinal ranking setting, to investigate if improved prediction performance could be achieved by the Deep Ordinal Ranking model.

However, our present ignorance should not be an impediment to arguing that landscapes warrant preservation. The conservation of diverse soilscapes should proceed simultaneously with scientific research that fully explores their qualities, values, and functioning. In less than two centuries, the landscape of the US has been transformed to a degree that would astound our 19th century predecessors. The change is not complete. Population growth and the on-going redistribution of the US population pose new and challenging issues to preservation efforts of all types. Soils, viewed during this expansion as an economic commodity, have in many cases become rare to the degree that we and others (Iba n ez and others 1995, 1998) suggest they become part of formal biodiversity planning.\\nThis initial quantitative analysis of land-use effects on soil diversity raises many questions and opportunities for future research. Some key directions include:\\n1. Use of improved soil databases: Our analysis, made with the generalized STATSGO database, contains numerous uncertainties as discussed in the text. In the near future, the USDA-NRCS will likely release the SSURGO (Soil Survey Geographical) database, which will be a digital compilation of detailed 1:24,000 soil surveys. This dataset will greatly refine both the number and location of heavily impacted soils in the US. However, the general method of our initial query using STATSGO will apply to the use of this improved database. 2.

The 1990 Condition of Education report to Congress by the U.S. Department of Education notes that among black 13-year-olds, 44.2% of males and 350/0 of females were below grade by one or more years in 1985 (U.S. Department of Education, 1990) . This compares with whites in which 29% of the males and 21% of the females were below grade. Although retentions and failures have increased for all groups since 1975, the below-grade-level rates have increased at nearly twice the rate for blacks as for whites in the past 15 years.\\nThese findings are reflected in data from the stratified national sample included in the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88; National Center for Education Statistics, 1989) . The NELS data show that 19.3% of the 16,623 white, black, and Hispanic public school students with complete data who were studied were retained at least once in kindergarten through eighth grade with 8 % of these students being retained in kindergarten or first grade. Further, 29.9% of the black students, and 25.2% of the Hispanic students repeated a grade, as contrasted to only 17.2% of the white students. Overall, boys outnumbered girl repeaters 24% to 15.3%; 33.9% of the repeaters were from the lowest SES quartile, as contrasted with 8.6% from the highest quartile (Meisels &amp; Liaw, 1991) .\\nResearch regarding retention demonstrates that the effects of retention are cause for great concern.

Allowing heavy grazing in vegetation &gt;30 cm tall may provide the shorter, sparser habitat preferred by Lark Buntings (Finch and others, 1987). Shortgrass habitats should not be heavily grazed during the summer (Giezentanner, 1970;Wiens, 1973;Ryder, 1980). Giezentanner (1970) and Ryder (1980) recommended light summer grazing or grazing during winter, provided that vegetative cover and height are not greatly reduced. In sagebrush grasslands, Golding and Dreitz (2017) indicated that a single grazing system (such as season-long grazing) can be used to alter the abundance of an individual songbird species (such as the Lark Bunting) but a mosaic of numerous grazing systems will maintain ecological functions and the abundance and distribution of the entire songbird community. In cultivated areas, disking and other mechanized disturbances may destroy nests and cause adult Lark Buntings to abandon nesting areas (Wilson, 1976;Faanes and Lingle, 1995). In North Dakota, Lark Buntings nested in cropland that was under minimum tillage (Lokemoen and Beiser, 1997). No-tillage or minimum tillage was recommended as an alternative to fall cultivation. Maintaining rangeland in good condition may reduce the risk of pest outbreaks and the need for pest management involving chemical control (McEwen and others, 1972). When pest management is required, McEwen and others (1972) recommended using only rapidly degrading chemicals of low toxicity to nontarget organisms and to apply them at the lowest application rates possible.

Studies have reported that early numeracy competencies acquired before starting elementary school affect students' later mathematics achievement (Aunio &amp; Niemivirta, 2010;Chiu, 2018;Duncan et al., 2007;Galindo &amp; Sonnenschein, 2015;Geary et al., 2018;Jordan et al., 2010;Siegler, 2016;Zhu &amp; Chiu, 2019). Because early numeracy competencies work as the basis for acquiring new mathematical knowledge in school, students with higher schoolentry numeracy competencies tend to have higher mathematics achievement in elementary school. For example, Duncan et al. (2007) conducted a meta-analysis with six longitudinal data sets in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. and concluded that the relationship between school entry mathematics competencies and later mathematics achievement was positively and statistically significant. More specifically, based on Early Childhood Longitudinal Study data examining 21 260 U.S. children, the authors reported that the regression coefficient of school-entry numeracy competencies on third-grade mathematics achievement was .53. That is, if school-entry numeracy competency is increased by 1 point, the average thirdgrade mathematics achievement increases by .53 after controlling other variables. Similarly, Jordan et al. (2010) examined the association between numeracy competencies at the beginning of kindergarten and first and third-grade mathematics achievement and found positive associations between them. Additionally, studies on Finland (Aunio &amp; Niemivirta, 2010), Hong Kong (Zhu &amp; Chiu, 2019), and Taiwan (Chiu, 2018) reported similar results. Studies have reported that, among many factors, early numeracy activities at home significantly affect students' early mathematics competencies (Anders et al., 2012;Casey et al., 2018;Huang et al.,</td>\n",

In addition, data were collected from teachers, principals, and parents to better understand the school and home contexts for the sample members. Both cohorts of HS&amp;B participants were resurveyed in 1982, 1984, and 1986; the sophomore group also responded in 1992. As in NLS-72, secondary and postsecondary transcripts were collected for the HS&amp;B cohorts. With the study design expanded to include a sophomore cohort, HS&amp;B provided critical data on the -relationships between early high school experiences and students' subsequent educational experiences in high school. For the first time, national data were , available showing students' academic growth over time and how family, community, school, and classroom factors promoted or inhibited student learning. Researchers were able to use data from the extensive battery of cognitive tests within the longitudinal study to assess growth in tested achievement over time. Moreover, data were then available to analyze the school experiences of students who later dropped out of high school. These data became a rich resource for policymakers and researchers over the next decade and provided an empirical base to inform the debates of the educational reform movement that began in the early 1980s. Much as NLS-72 captured a high school cohort of the 1970s and HS&amp;B high school cohorts of the 1980s, NELS:88 was designed to study high school students of the 1990sbut with a premeasure of their achievement and status, prior to their entry into high school.

Third, we address a potential difference in the purpose of taking SAT coaching between East Asian American students and other racial/ethnic students by examining the relationship between prior achievement and SAT coaching. Some racial/ethnic groups may take SAT coaching to keep up with their peers (remedial purposes), while other racial/ethnic groups may do so to stay ahead of their peers (enrichment purposes). By examining potential variation among racial/ethnic groups in the relationships between prior achievement and SAT coaching, we can better address the nature of SAT coaching for each racial/ethnic group. Finally, we examine potential racial/ethnic variation in the effect of using the two forms of SAT coaching on SAT performance. Depending on various factors that affect SAT coaching as well as characteristics of students who take it, taking a commercial SAT test preparation course or receiving private tutoring can be particularly beneficial for certain racial/ethnic groups than others.

Likewise, 67 percent of specialized farrowing operations and more than 90 percent of specialized weanling operations used contractual arrangements. In contrast, contract production was virtually nonexistent on farrow-to-finish farms.\\nThe average size of hog operations increased from 1992 to 2004 but grew the fastest for operations producing under contract ( fig. 6 ). Contract feeder pig-to-finish operations averaged about 1,000 more head produced in 1992 than did other operations. By 1998, contract operations averaged 3,700 more head than other operations, and the difference reached 4,500 head in 2004.

That is, hogs generated 71 percent of the total value of farm production on these farms. The share of farm product value from hogs increased most rapidly, from 35 to 72 percent, on hog-finishing operations. Sources of hog feed also indicate increasing specialization in hog production. Grain produced on the same farm accounted for half of the feed consumed by hogs in 1992 but fell below 20 percent by 2004. Again, specialized hogfinishing operations accounted for the fastest change (from 45 to 15 percent). The resulting farms-with greater shares of production value   \n",

These batch effect adjusted values are included in the Intermediate Data Level 2. Overall, this scaling factor was small (typically less than 10%), as can be seen by the raw reported NIST SRM-1950 values reported in Online-only Table 2 .\\nThe next step of QC involved filtering based on quality metrics. We routinely applied filter criteria to each of the metabolites (based on the blinded ADNI 1 duplicates or ADNI 2/GO triplicates) to allow only the most robust analytes to be included in downstream analysis. Separately for each cohort, we used a coefficient of variation (CV) <30% across plates to filter out metabolites with limited variation and therefore statistical power for analysis. Next, we used an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between the values for the blinded duplicate (or triplicate) analyes >0.6. Finally, analytes with >40% of measurements below the lower limit of detection (<LOD) were filtered out. This filtered data represents the Level 3 data matrix. This filtering reduced the total number of analytes reported from 20 analytes (Level 2) to 15 analytes (Level 3). The filter QC results are presented in detail in the Supplementary Table 1 .\\nThe next step in data processing performs missing value replacement, by imputing any values reported as reported as '<LOD' were using LOD/2 value for each specific analyte. Additionally, we screened for outliers for removal prior to analysis. In ADNI 1, there were a total of 71 samples identified as outliers based on the following criteria: 69 samples identified as non-fasting, 2 samples lacking corresponding body mass index (BMI) values, and 1 for which no baseline medication record was    \n",

Many agritourism activities make use of land unsuitable for crop and livestock production. Consequently, adding agritourism to a farm's operations does not necessarily displace crop and livestock production. In addition, agritourism mainly involves domestic suppliers and consumers; it suffers less than other agricultural commodities from global competition (Veeck, Che, and Veeck 2006) .\\nThe local focus of agritourism can benefi t surrounding communities. Farm visitors who purchase local goods and services (including farm products) stimulate the community's economy 1 In our analysis explaining farmers' involvement in agritourism, we ran variations of the model that included individual dummy variables to represent farms specializing in grain, vegetables, fruits, cattle and calves, and dairy production. None of the resulting coeffi cients (shown with t-values in parentheses) was signifi cant: grains, 0.0047 (0.0114); cattle and calves, -0.047 (-0.192); dairy, -0.127 (-0.187); vegetables, -0.121 (-0.156); fruits, 0.183 (0.332) . These results suggest that agritourism does not signifi cantly displace these crop and livestock operations. (Saxena et al. 2007 ). As agritourism attracts urban dwellers to rural areas, urban tourists, especially teens and young adults, have an opportunity to develop an appreciation for rural people and places through their interactions with rural residents. In addition, agritourism can enhance a \"sense of place\" for local residents, giving them more reasons to stay and invest in their communities.\\nThe magnitude of the local economic impacts of agritourism farms can be gauged by examining data from the 2007 Agricultural Resource Management Survey   \n",

This increases the group size to 28,000 and lowers the percent completing STEM bachelor's degrees to 79%-only a slight decline.\\nGroup 6 is the same as Group 5 except that an AP score of 3 or more is needed-we do not substitute a science fair award for an AP score. Although this causes the group size to fall to 23,000, this more restrictive group does not have a higher percentage completing a STEM degree, but rather the percentage completing STEM degrees falls slightly to 77%. This suggests that a science fair award in high school is a useful predictor of STEM bachelor's degree completion. Further, it suggests that Group 6 is unnecessary. Group 5 is closer to the desired size and uses a relevant variable, science fair awards, that is not used in Group 6.\\nThese findings are consistent with Lubinski and Benbow's (2006) study of mathematically precocious youth. For 13-year-old students testing in the top 1% of mathematic ability (approximately 30,000 students nationwide), Lubinski and Benbow found 62% of males and 54% of females eventually earned STEM baccalaureates. Statistics for those testing in the top 0.5% (approximately 15,000 students nationally) that earn STEM degrees are 76% of males and 61% respectively. Depending on definition, somewhere between 60% to 82% of likely PACE winners are completing STEM degrees without the PACE program. The direct marginal impact of the program would depend on the portion of non-STEM degree recipients who would complete a STEM degree because of PACE.\\nSome, but not all, of the best students can be influenced to complete a STEM degree by prestigious scholarship awards.   \n",

It assumes 1) a partition scheme exists among predictors, and 2) predictors within one partition should have similar weights.

Two-year entrants are also significantly more likely to have a job during their first year of college, and (among those who do have a job) to work longer hours per week during term time. We have demonstrated that community college students are substantially less likely to earn a bachelor's degree than similar 4-year students after matching on a broad set of observable characteristics. But how sensitive are these results to the presence of an unmeasured confounder?\\nWhen conducting a sensitivity analysis, we ask two questions simultaneously. The first has to do with the size of the hypothetical selection effect: How much more common would an unmeasured characteristic have to be in the treatment rather than the control group (or vice versa) to eliminate the observed treatment effect? We are asking here about the impact of the unobserved variable on assignment to treatment. The second has to do with the effect on the outcome: How much more common must an unmeasured confounder be among \"successes\" (BA-earners) than \"failures\" (non-earners) to account for observed differences? The unobserved characteristic has to affect both selection into treatment and the outcome (probability of \"success\") to be a confounder.

The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 subjects, ages 55-90, including 200 normal controls, 400 individuals with MCI, and 200 subjects with mild AD at approximately 50 sites in the United States and Canada for longitudinal follow up. ADNI also aims to accurately track progression of the disease and devise tests to measure the effectiveness of potential interventions. Currently, the study involves over 1,000 participants, including people without memory problems, those with MCI, and patients with diagnosed AD. Early diagnosis of AD is key to the development, assessment, and monitoring of new treatments for AD. Approaches to characterize AD progression will help researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness. Further, being able to understand disease progression will increase the safety and efficacy of drug development and potentially decrease the time and cost of clinical trails. The ADNI project is a longitudinal study, where selected subjects are categorized into three BL diagnostic groups: CN, MCI, and AD, repeatedly over a 6-month or 1-year interval. The date when the subjects are scheduled to perform the screening becomes BL after approval and the time point for the follow-up visits is denoted by the duration starting from the BL. We use the notation Month 6 (M6) to denote the time point half year after the first visit. Currently, ADNI has up to Month 48 follow-up data available for some patients. However, many patients drop out from the study for many reasons.\\nIn this work, we conduct empirical evaluation for the proposed methods on MRI data.

It provides a student with some insight into the extent to which they may need extra mathematical support, if at all, as opposed to telling them that they do or do not need it. In addition to this, the discriminant function is a classification method which is evidence based as opposed to the diagnostic test classification which is based on a subjective expert opinion only. The prediction analysis carried on in this research therefore did improve somewhat on the current system that was in place (i.e the diagnostic test). The discriminant analysis also helped to refine the cut-off point of the diagnostic test slightly by establishing that a student who receives 18/40 or below is 'at risk' of failing service mathematics as opposed to the 19/40 cut-off point which is currently in operation. The examination of students' probabilities of failure in service mathematics on entry to higher education and allowing for appropriate mathematics remediation to be put in for specific cohorts of students is one way of attempting to maintain degree standards in higher education.\\nThe fourth and final research question contained within this research was an examination into what effect (if any) gender had on mathematics attainment in 3 rd level education. The effect of gender on mathematics attainment and consequently its strength as a predictor of service mathematics performance was found to be negligible.\\nThis finding reiterates what was outlined in a meta-analysis of 100 studies between 1963-1988 in which gender differences in mathematics performance were not found to be significant [61] .

Of note, although the network-wide measures in the analyses above indicated associations with cognition, the voxel-level results demonstrated substantial regional variation in the strength of the correlation between network connectivity at a given voxel and each cognitive domain. These results, presented at a liberal threshold, suggest that relationships with cognition likely occur across multiple regions within a network and are general across cognitive domains, but that there may nonetheless be important regional variability to be explored. In particular, although the SN and DAN had weak or no relationships with cognition when using network-wide metrics (Table 1) , these networks showed evidence of regionally specific relationships with similar magnitude to those observed in the DN and FPCN (Fig. 2) . One feature of the TBR method is that the network templates are not required to be orthogonal to one another, and each voxel will be assigned a value representing its association to every template in the analysis. Because the resulting network connectivity metrics are correlated with each other (Supplementary Table S1 ), it remains possible that the above results represent a general influence of an individual's average connectivity across networks on cognition, rather than a specific relationship between connectivity in a given network and a particular cognitive domain. We therefore examined the correlations between connectivity in each network and each cognitive domain controlling for age, QA metrics, and connectivity in each of the other three networks.

In less than two centuries, the landscape of the US has been transformed to a degree that would astound our 19th century predecessors. The change is not complete. Population growth and the on-going redistribution of the US population pose new and challenging issues to preservation efforts of all types.

The 1990 Condition of Education report to Congress by the U.S. Department of Education notes that among black 13-year-olds, 44.2% of males and 350/0 of females were below grade by one or more years in 1985 (U.S. Department of Education, 1990) . This compares with whites in which 29% of the males and 21% of the females were below grade. Although retentions and failures have increased for all groups since 1975, the below-grade-level rates have increased at nearly twice the rate for blacks as for whites in the past 15 years.\\nThese findings are reflected in data from the stratified national sample included in the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88; National Center for Education Statistics, 1989) . The NELS data show that 19.3% of the 16,623 white, black, and Hispanic public school students with complete data who were studied were retained at least once in kindergarten through eighth grade with 8 % of these students being retained in kindergarten or first grade. Further, 29.9% of the black students, and 25.2% of the Hispanic students repeated a grade, as contrasted to only 17.2% of the white students.

Allowing heavy grazing in vegetation >30 cm tall may provide the shorter, sparser habitat preferred by Lark Buntings (Finch and others, 1987). Shortgrass habitats should not be heavily grazed during the summer (Giezentanner, 1970;Wiens, 1973;Ryder, 1980). Giezentanner (1970) and Ryder (1980) recommended light summer grazing or grazing during winter, provided that vegetative cover and height are not greatly reduced. In sagebrush grasslands, Golding and Dreitz (2017) indicated that a single grazing system (such as season-long grazing) can be used to alter the abundance of an individual songbird species (such as the Lark Bunting) but a mosaic of numerous grazing systems will maintain ecological functions and the abundance and distribution of the entire songbird community. In cultivated areas, disking and other mechanized disturbances may destroy nests and cause adult Lark Buntings to abandon nesting areas (Wilson, 1976;Faanes and Lingle, 1995). In North Dakota, Lark Buntings nested in cropland that was under minimum tillage (Lokemoen and Beiser, 1997). No-tillage or minimum tillage was recommended as an alternative to fall cultivation. Maintaining rangeland in good condition may reduce the risk of pest outbreaks and the need for pest management involving chemical control (McEwen and others, 1972). When pest management is required, McEwen and others (1972) recommended using only rapidly degrading chemicals of low toxicity to nontarget organisms and to apply them at the lowest application rates possible.

Studies have reported that early numeracy competencies acquired before starting elementary school affect students' later mathematics achievement (Aunio & Niemivirta, 2010;Chiu, 2018;Duncan et al., 2007;Galindo & Sonnenschein, 2015;Geary et al., 2018;Jordan et al., 2010;Siegler, 2016;Zhu & Chiu, 2019). Because early numeracy competencies work as the basis for acquiring new mathematical knowledge in school, students with higher schoolentry numeracy competencies tend to have higher mathematics achievement in elementary school. For example, Duncan et al. (2007) conducted a meta-analysis with six longitudinal data sets in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. and concluded that the relationship between school entry mathematics competencies and later mathematics achievement was positively and statistically significant. More specifically, based on Early Childhood Longitudinal Study data examining 21 260 U.S. children, the authors reported that the regression coefficient of school-entry numeracy competencies on third-grade mathematics achievement was .53. That is, if school-entry numeracy competency is increased by 1 point, the average thirdgrade mathematics achievement increases by .53 after controlling other variables. Similarly, Jordan et al. (2010) examined the association between numeracy competencies at the beginning of kindergarten and first and third-grade mathematics achievement and found positive associations between them. Additionally, studies on Finland (Aunio & Niemivirta, 2010), Hong Kong (Zhu & Chiu, 2019), and Taiwan (Chiu, 2018) reported similar results. Studies have reported that, among many factors, early numeracy activities at home significantly affect students' early mathematics competencies (Anders et al., 2012;Casey et al., 2018;Huang et al.,   \n",

With the study design expanded to include a sophomore cohort, HS&B provided critical data on the -relationships between early high school experiences and students' subsequent educational experiences in high school. For the first time, national data were , available showing students' academic growth over time and how family, community, school, and classroom factors promoted or inhibited student learning. Researchers were able to use data from the extensive battery of cognitive tests within the longitudinal study to assess growth in tested achievement over time. Moreover, data were then available to analyze the school experiences of students who later dropped out of high school. These data became a rich resource for policymakers and researchers over the next decade and provided an empirical base to inform the debates of the educational reform movement that began in the early 1980s. Much as NLS-72 captured a high school cohort of the 1970s and HS&B high school cohorts of the 1980s, NELS:88 was designed to study high school students of the 1990sbut with a premeasure of their achievement and status, prior to their entry into high school.

This may also be true for shadow education, given that it has been a major feature of education in East Asian societies such as Japan (Cummings 1997;Mori and Baker 2010;Stevenson and Baker 1992;Yamamoto and Brinton 2010), Korea (Byun 2009;Park et al. 2011), and Hong Kong (Bray and Kwok 2003), even though it is increasingly becoming a worldwide phenomenon (Baker and LeTendre 2005;Bray 2009;Lee, Park, and Lee 2009). By distinguishing East Asian American students from other Asian American students, we can better address variation in the prevalence of SAT coaching among students of diverse racial/ethnic background. Third, we address a potential difference in the purpose of taking SAT coaching between East Asian American students and other racial/ethnic students by examining the relationship between prior achievement and SAT coaching. Some racial/ethnic groups may take SAT coaching to keep up with their peers (remedial purposes), while other racial/ethnic groups may do so to stay ahead of their peers (enrichment purposes). By examining potential variation among racial/ethnic groups in the relationships between prior achievement and SAT coaching, we can better address the nature of SAT coaching for each racial/ethnic group. Finally, we examine potential racial/ethnic variation in the effect of using the two forms of SAT coaching on SAT performance. Depending on various factors that affect SAT coaching as well as characteristics of students who take it, taking a commercial SAT test preparation course or receiving private tutoring can be particularly beneficial for certain racial/ethnic groups than others. In this study, we elaborate on several factors that may yield SAT coaching to be particularly effective among East    \n",

(email: cruchagc@psychiatry.wustl.edu). technological developments have made possible the quantification of multiple proteins in a single analytical procedure, allowing both broader and deeper molecular profiling of large cohorts 2, [7] [8] [9] [10] . Genetic analyses of these data have discovered numerous genomic regions associated with clinically relevant proteins, with recent large-scale proteome analyses having identified many loci associated with serum and plasma concentrations of individual proteins 2, [7] [8] [9] [10] . Nevertheless, our understanding of the genetic basis and pathophysiological impact of variations in protein levels remains far from complete. Most of these studies limited analyses to cis variants or focused on candidate regions rather than genome-wide scans 2,7-9 . Recent research suggests the importance of investigating protein phenotypes beyond those used in traditional genetic studies 10 .\\nHere we present the results of an unbiased large genetic investigation of protein phenotypes in 818 unrelated individuals from the Washington University Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (KADRC) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)   \n",
