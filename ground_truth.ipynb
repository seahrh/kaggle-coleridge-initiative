We failed to detect significant correlation between the two (correlation coefficient = 0.06, p = 0 25; Figure 3 ). This is consistent with the findings of the GIANT consortium. With a population of 1914 individuals, Wood et al. found a predictive r 2 = 0 14 for 697 SNPs (20% variation explained) [10] . It is expected that this r 2 should be stronger than the correlation coefficient in our findings because of our smaller population size of 407 individuals of the ADNI and Cache County individuals as well as the fact that the GIANT consortium identified the 697 SNPs used for prediction directly from their population of 1914 individuals. While research has shown that height is a polygenic trait heavily influenced by common SNPs [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] , a polygenic score that quantifies common SNP effect is generally insufficient for successful individual phenotype prediction. We demonstrate that in the case of Mr. Bradley, a rare combination of common SNPs corresponds to an extremely high polygenic score that predicts an extreme phenotype.

When we consider a prototype from the engineering perspective, it seems natural that the capability exists to extract performance information from the executing program, whether it is considered an experiment, as in [I] and [9], or a model. Observing the output at this window, the designer is able to observe and analyze data extracted from the executing prototype, including operational parameters, performance indicators, and whatever other instrumentation is incorporated into the prototype, and track the progress of the prototype. The second part of our hypothesis concerns the flexibility of the model and the ways in which RBP can benefit the computer software development process.

Although school-age Latinos have had lower reading and math scores compared with other students, they have been making steady gains in terms of grade point averages, standardized test scores, and high school credits earned (Llagas &amp; Snyder, 2003) . However, academic credentials that make one eligible for a 4-year college do not automatically lead to enrollment. The National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS:88; National Center for Education Statistics [NCES], n.d.-b) data showed that \"almost 40 percent of Latino students considered worthy academically for four-year studies failed to enroll at a four-year institution\" (Swail et al., 2004, p. 18 ). Kurlaender (2006) was able to demonstrate that Latinos scoring close to 100% on the NELS:88 math achievement test still had a 40% to 50% probability of choosing a 2-year over a 4-year college, compared with less than a 10% rate for African Americans and European Americans.

Other studies have likewise reported change points in visuospatial functioning [21, 22] and semantic memory functioning [22] . Taken together, longitudinal studies of cognitive functioning in future AD patients suggest that bilateral medial and anterior temporal lobe as well as frontal lobe dysfunction underpin the earliest cognitive impairments in AD, consistent with the sites of beginning neurofibrillary pathology [23] , and that these changes appear approximately seven years prior to diagnosis.\\nEarly pathological changes in AD may be manifested in subtle, qualitative neuropsychological dysfunction, before quantitative impairments emerge [2] .

Making allowances for low scores in line with the BRLS may help to minimize false positives when diagnosing MCI. The aim of this study was to test this idea by comparing the risk-AD of participants classified with MCI using standard approaches and when the BRLS is considered. In using the BRLS for diagnosing MCI, we expected to find individuals with MCI to have a higher risk-AD than normal controls and better prediction of progression to AD than with standard criteria.

What's more, it influedced glucose metabolism of right temporal. HMGCR (rs3846662) plays an important role in AD-related neurodegenerative processes. Therefore, identification of specific factors that regulate HMGCR alternative splicing and elucidating the underlying mechanism may lead to a better understanding of its impact on regulating cellular cholesterol homeostasis and neurodegenerative processes. It is necessary to explore more clear understanding on the mechanisms in a larger sample, with longer follow-up and a wider range of people.

Parental effort equations are also estimated as a function of child, parent, household, and school characteristics. Our results suggest that parental effort has a strong positive effect on achievement that is large relative to the effect of school resources and is not captured by family background variables. Parents appear to reduce their effort in response to increased school resources, suggesting potential ''crowding out'' of school resources. There is a long-standing debate whether improving school financial resources will improve student achievement. Some have found positive effects (Hedges and Greenwald 1996; Krueger 1999) while others have found negligible or even negative effects (see Hanushek 1996) .

       "      <td>currently suffering from AD-related dementia. In 2018 alone, the total financial cost associated with health care, long-term care, and hospice services for patients suffering from dementia was estimated to be $277 billion. It is forecasted that by 2050, the number of people suffering from AD will surpass 13.8 million. Furthermore, the Alzheimer's Association emphasizes that early detection and diagnosis of individuals with AD could save up to $7.9 trillion in associated medical costs. With the projected increase in individual hardship and financial burden caused by AD, it is essential that the scientific community develop computational methods for early diagnosis and treatment of AD.\\nA central research component, designed to assist in early identification of dementia, has focused on discovering characteristic biomarkers that are closely associated with the development of AD. This branch of research has been driven by the successful development and deployment of a variety of non-invasive clinical observations such as positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, and genetic analysis through the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).

This study was approved by the medical ethics committee of the University Medical Center Utrecht, the Netherlands, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.\\nOf 1010 downloaded ADNI scans, 10 failed WMH segmentation quality control, 2 had incomplete data, 65 were duplicate scans, and 3 participants had no baseline diagnostic information. After quality control of WMHs, 22 cases were reprocessed with the appropriate modifications, as per the reprocessing step. All baseline 3T T1-weighted and 3T T2-weighted FLAIR images were downloaded for ADNIGo and ADNI2 patients on 6th November 2014. The ADNI MRI protocol is described in detail elsewhere (Jack et al. 2008) . Axial 3T FLAIR was acquired with voxel sizes of 0.85994  0.8594  5 mm. Following acquisition, each image underwent quality control at the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN) which included protocol compliance check, inspection for clinically significant medical abnormalities, and image quality assessment.\\nFor semi-automated segmentation, T1-weighted images were registered to T2 FLAIR images, as WMH are clearer, and more easily viewed on T2 FLAIR. T1-weighted images were co-registered to FLAIR using Reg-Aladdin in NiftyReg (https://github.com/KCL-BMEIS/niftyreg) (Modat et al. 2014) .</td>\n",

However, in order to set the context for the question, lengthy text-based scenarios are often included. These questions then rely on students' reading abilities as much as on their science knowledge. The readability scores for this introduction based on the SMOG test is 10th grade, and yet this question is on the 4th grade test! In addition, the question includes a set of pictures and a data table to analyze. Clearly this question is testing reading as much as it is science, which disadvantages English language learners and poor readers. In Pennsylvania, a state where the population of English language learners has more than doubled in the last 10 years (in Philadelphia alone it tops 15% of the student body) and 33% of all students fail to reach reading proficiency (in Philadelphia 60% fail to reach reading proficiency), reliance on English reading skills calls into question how to use scores on tests like these. Does a student's score indicate their science knowledge or their reading ability? For some students, this is unclear.\\nThis issue is not relegated to U.S. tests alone.

We failed to detect significant correlation between the two (correlation coefficient = 0.06, p = 0 25; Figure 3 ). This is consistent with the findings of the GIANT consortium. With a population of 1914 individuals, Wood et al. found a predictive r 2 = 0 14 for 697 SNPs (20% variation explained) [10] . It is expected that this r 2 should be stronger than the correlation coefficient in our findings because of our smaller population size of 407 individuals of the ADNI and Cache County individuals as well as the fact that the GIANT consortium identified the 697 SNPs used for prediction directly from their population of 1914 individuals. While research has shown that height is a polygenic trait heavily influenced by common SNPs [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] , a polygenic score that quantifies common SNP effect is generally insufficient for successful individual phenotype prediction. We demonstrate that in the case of Mr. Bradley, a rare combination of common SNPs corresponds to an extremely high polygenic score that predicts an extreme phenotype.

When we consider a prototype from the engineering perspective, it seems natural that the capability exists to extract performance information from the executing program, whether it is considered an experiment, as in [I] and [9], or a model. Observing the output at this window, the designer is able to observe and analyze data extracted from the executing prototype, including operational parameters, performance indicators, and whatever other instrumentation is incorporated into the prototype, and track the progress of the prototype. The second part of our hypothesis concerns the flexibility of the model and the ways in which RBP can benefit the computer software development process. Consideration of this issue is the area in which our work has the potential to make a contribution to the body of knowledge in computer science. Our goal in this part of our project is to provide new insights into prototyping and reconfiguration that can be used as reference material for further experimentation with the RBP approach.\\nCentral to our contention that prototyping can be more effectively undertaken using our model is the presentation of a case-in-point.

Although school-age Latinos have had lower reading and math scores compared with other students, they have been making steady gains in terms of grade point averages, standardized test scores, and high school credits earned (Llagas & Snyder, 2003) . However, academic credentials that make one eligible for a 4-year college do not automatically lead to enrollment. The National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS:88; National Center for Education Statistics [NCES], n.d.-b) data showed that \"almost 40 percent of Latino students considered worthy academically for four-year studies failed to enroll at a four-year institution\" (Swail et al., 2004, p. 18 ). Kurlaender (2006) was able to demonstrate that Latinos scoring close to 100% on the NELS:88 math achievement test still had a 40% to 50% probability of choosing a 2-year over a 4-year college, compared with less than a 10% rate for African Americans and European Americans.

However, Riley and colleagues [20] found faster rates of cognitive decline in semantic memory and visuospatial construction in future AD patients' compared to individuals who remained cognitively healthy. Other studies have likewise reported change points in visuospatial functioning [21, 22] and semantic memory functioning [22] . Taken together, longitudinal studies of cognitive functioning in future AD patients suggest that bilateral medial and anterior temporal lobe as well as frontal lobe dysfunction underpin the earliest cognitive impairments in AD, consistent with the sites of beginning neurofibrillary pathology [23] , and that these changes appear approximately seven years prior to diagnosis.\\nEarly pathological changes in AD may be manifested in subtle, qualitative neuropsychological dysfunction, before quantitative impairments emerge [2] . While most longitudinal studies have not addressed this hypothesis, the neuropsychological literature has documented qualitative abnormalities in AD patients' neuropsychological performance that represent potential candidates for qualitative preclinical mar   \n",

Making allowances for low scores in line with the BRLS may help to minimize false positives when diagnosing MCI. The aim of this study was to test this idea by comparing the risk-AD of participants classified with MCI using standard approaches and when the BRLS is considered. In using the BRLS for diagnosing MCI, we expected to find individuals with MCI to have a higher risk-AD than normal controls and better prediction of progression to AD than with standard criteria.

Hence, more studies are needed to perform to fill the gaps.\\nIn general, it is possible that HMGCR (rs3846662) could be involved in the structural and functional modification of right entorhinal and left hippocampus throughout the AD physiopathological process. What's more, it influedced glucose metabolism of right temporal. HMGCR (rs3846662) plays an important role in AD-related neurodegenerative processes. Therefore, identification of specific factors that regulate HMGCR alternative splicing and elucidating the underlying mechanism may lead to a better understanding of its impact on regulating cellular cholesterol homeostasis and neurodegenerative processes. It is necessary to explore more clear understanding on the mechanisms in a larger sample, with longer follow-up and a wider range of people.  Data used in this article were got from the ADNI database (www.loni.ucla.edu\\ADNI).

Comparing and contrasting hiring and average age in these institutions in different time periods provide insights into the effects of late retirement on US faculty workforce. The second study confirms conclusions of the simulation model. Overall, this study offers a different perspective to explain a source of problems of early career scientists, and the interconnections in the science workforce, stressing the inadequacy of looking at the young faculty population in isolation. The study shows the magnified effects of late retirement on the growth in average academic age through two mechanisms-a longer stay of established professors and a decline in the hiring rate of newly minted PhDs. We discuss our findings and offer several policy implications to help early career scientists in the U.S.  Data.

Parental effort equations are also estimated as a function of child, parent, household, and school characteristics. Our results suggest that parental effort has a strong positive effect on achievement that is large relative to the effect of school resources and is not captured by family background variables. Parents appear to reduce their effort in response to increased school resources, suggesting potential ''crowding out'' of school resources. There is a long-standing debate whether improving school financial resources will improve student achievement. Some have found positive effects (Hedges and Greenwald 1996; Krueger 1999) while others have found negligible or even negative effects (see Hanushek 1996) .
