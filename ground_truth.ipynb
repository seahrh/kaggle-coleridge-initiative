Furthermore, there are two species of eelgrass that thrive in Willapa Bay, each with a unique signature. North American eelgrass (Zostera Marina) is larger leafed than Asian eelgrass (Zostera Japonica) and tends to occupy the inter-tidal zone (Backman, 1991;Phillips, 1984). The lighter hue of Asian eelgrass could easily be detected on the tidal flats, but could not be clearly distinguished from North American eelgrass in the inter-tidal zone. The combination of the two eelgrass species in the inter-tidal zone provided a unique spectral signature of its own, leading to three different signatures of eelgrass. There were other unidentifiable spectral signatures for which no source could be located. Several regions in the northern end of the study area had received sediment deposition following the flight mission and consequently no source for reflectance could be determined. The use of preliminary data gathered to measure spectral signatures was critical for the accurate interpretation of the Willapa Bay eelgrass photo set and will prove to be an integral component to future eelgrass distribution studies in Willapa Bay. Determining the size of the minimum mapping unit for this study proved to be problematic due to the presence of a non-native rush, Spartina spp., throughout Willapa Bay. C-CAP guidelines suggest that a minimum mapping unit of .03 hectares on the ground is appropriate for SRV distribution studies under ideal conditions. However, the prolific growth of Spartina spp., throughout Willapa Bay created a situation where countless island polygons of Spartina spp., clones would need to be excluded from eelgrass beds if the .03 hectare minimum mapping unit was used. To avoid mapping Spartina spp. rather than eelgrass, the minimum mapping unit size was increased to 1/10\" or 2.54 millimeters on the</td>\n",

Aransas Pass (Corpus Christi Ship Channel), between Mustang Island and San Jose Island, which accounts for the majority of the tidal exchange between the bay and the Gulf of Mexico. Packery Channel, between the southwestern end of Mustang Island and North Padre Island, is manmade inlet that supplies a lesser amount of the bay's tidal exchange. Overall, the natural depth of the bay is relatively shallow, with an average depth of approximately 9 feet. Tides in Corpus Christi Bay under normal conditions are very small in amplitude, usually less than 3 feet between low and high tide. Wind speed and direction within Corpus Christi Bay plays an important role in affecting tide elevation. It can dampen or enhance the height of waves as well as their potential energy. Prevailing winds are from the southeast, with occasional strong northerly winds that are associated with passing cold fronts. Winds combined with seasonal tide events can greatly exacerbate the tidal range as well as move the range up or down by 1 or 2 feet. Storm tides during Category 4 or 5 hurricanes could be as high as 15-20 feet above normal water levels according to NOAA's Sea, Lake, and Overland Surge from Hurricanes (SLOSH) Model. The project site is located along Indian Point in Upper Corpus Christi Bay. Indian Point is a small peninsula that extends from the northeastern shore and extends towards Rincon Point on the southwestern shore.

While this fitting method deviates from recommendations by KZ07 regarding how the fit should be performed (i.e., observations should be binned and then fit), the focus here is on interagency and interannual differences rather than the absolute accuracy of any one formula. Such an analysis shows how operational procedures might have changed over time. The WPR parameters are shown in Fig. 3 as a time series along with the root-mean-square (RMS) error of the empirical fit and V 920, the wind speed corresponding to MCP 5 920 hPa. The RMS values provide insights into how much an agency followed any WPR. For instance, AR ended in 1987, thus forcing agencies to estimate intensity from satellites more often, as is done in Dvorak (1984) . The result is that after 1987, the maximum RMS is small (about 6 kt) because both wind and pressure were derived from the same satellite estimate. Conversely, RMS values in the early record (e.g., before 1970) show RMS values exceeding 15 kt, implying a consistent WPR was not routinely used to constrain wind to pressure or vice versa. It is of note that the RMS rarely shows a step change in any time series. The RMSs for TD-9635 and CMA gradually drift from more than 10 kt to near 5 kt in the 1980s. An exception is the JTWC switch to a different WPR in 2007.\\nThe impact of any change in procedures can be seen in the V 920 time series (Fig. 3, bottom) . Given the small bias compared to AR pressure data, any change in this value implies that there is likely a temporal bias in the reported wind speeds that could preclude climatic analysis (i.e., direct comparisons between years with vastly different V 920 ). The CMA and TD-9635 show a drift from 140-160 kt in the early record to 120 kt in the 1970s. It is likely a change in operational practice caused this gradual change. Given the previous validation of MCP from CMA (cf. Fig. 2) , it is possible that winds for CMA before 1970 are</td>\n",

The concept of a CSA program is grounded in linking consumers to their food source and farmers. As a result, CSA programs sometimes require members to \"volunteer\" on the farm. Some volunteers might help with the planting, others with weeding during the growing season and others with the harvest. Approximately 15% of the CSA farms in our sample required members to work on the farm a mandatory number of hours. Proposition 1 predicts that the price difference between yield shares and weight shares will be determined by two potentially competing factors, the yield premium and the risk premium.\\nGiven the anecdotal evidence discussed above, we expect that the yield premium will be near zero (though this is not testable directly in our data set) and that the risk premium will be positive (weight shares cost more) due to negative covariance of prices and yields. We conduct a regression analysis to test the resulting prediction that weight shares will be more costly, on average, and to estimate the extra cost under the assumption that the yield premium is zero.\\nSpecifically, we model the price of a share as a function of the share type while controlling for other factors that affect share price, including the products produced by the farm and offered through the CSA program, the farming practices, the pick-up location, the state where the CSA farm is located, and other outlets through which the farm sells its products. We estimate the following equation using ordinary least squares (OLS). Our econometric model is a basic hedonic pricing approach. Firm-level data, in this case the prices charged by the CSA farms, can only be used to estimate hedonic models if price-cost markups are first eliminated and the competitiveness of the market is</td>\n",

Aggregate pre-test scores and mean SES were treated as global school characteristics because these variables must be controlled to assess the effects of Catholic schools.

However, this aspect might only have contributed to the discrimination between dementia patients and control subjects but not to the high classification accuracy of AD and FTLD patients as these were very similar in their age range. If age contributed to the classification accuracy there should be lower classification accuracy for young dementia patients and older control subjects as they did not differ in age. For comparison of both types of dementia patients and control subjects the classification accuracy did not differ for younger and older dementia patients although half of the patients were in the same age range as the control group. In AD group all patients were classified correctly. In FTLD group one younger and one older patient were misclassified. Independently of age, all control subjects were classified correctly for both comparisons. These results indicate that the slight mean age differences is not the decisive factor for the high discrimination accuracy using combined information from FDG-PET and MRI. Furthermore, if age still slightly contributed to the high discrimination of dementia patients and control subjects this contribution was also present in all other single modality and multimodal whole-brain and ROI-based SVM classifications applied in this study. Therefore, age cannot account for increased differentiation accuracies when combined ROI information from FDG-PET and MRI are used for differentiation of dementia patients and control subjects.\\nAnother point is that subjects in the control group in our study reported subjective cognitive complaints which might have limited the interpretation of the results of our study.

We were not able to fit all three explanatory variables in one model as there was no overlap of the temperature ranges between the two regions.

Our analysis of historical hydrographic data has shown the mean position of the SACCF to be much further east than in other work; this makes fluctuations in the western extent of the front much more important in terms of delivering krill into regions accessible by the predators. Eddies shed from the front may also transport krill into the region, thus the timing and frequency of these events and the fate of the eddies may have an impact on the South Georgia ecosystem. The resolution of the close proximity of the SACCF to the southern shelf of South Georgia shows that the SACCF may play an important role in transport to the southern South Georgia region. Once material reaches the South Georgia shelf, on-shelf processes such as tides may act to retain or circulate it on-shelf. These processes could provide an alternative transport route for passive drifters to reach the western end of South Georgia. Finally, a note on the dynamics of the system. The short period of model output, with only two occurrences of the large westward shift in the position of the retroflection, means that we cannot definitively determine the mechanisms for the westward extensions of the SACCF and the related eddy-shedding. However, the wind forcing in the run of OCCAM considered here is the only forcing that is not cyclical (recall that surface temperature and salinity are relaxed to monthly climatological Levitus 1994 data, Section 3.1). The infrequency of the large extensions of the SACCF retroflection suggests that there might be a signal in the wind stress that predisposes the front to move zonally. Time series of the mean zonal and meridional wind stress averaged over the Scotia Sea (50 -65jS, 70 -30jW) and over the study region, however, show no consistent feature that corresponds to the westward extensions of the SACCF.

Eligibility criteria were as follows (see Petersen et al., 2010 , for a description of participant recruitment and classification protocol). Normal elderly controls had a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 24 or higher [45] , a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) of 0 [46] , and no diagnosis of neurological disease or psychiatric disorder. MCI patients had a MMSE score of 24 or higher, a subjective memory complaint, objective memory loss measured by education adjusted scores on the Wechsler Memory Scale Logical Memory II, a CDR score of 0.5, absence of significant levels of impairment in other cognitive domains, preserved activities of daily living (ADLs), and an absence of dementia [47] . Participants with mild AD were enrolled if they had a MMSE score between 20 and 26 (inclusive), a CDR score of 0.5 or 1.0, and met NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable AD [48] .\\nAt the initiation of our study, 489 ADNI</td>\n",

A recent home-based environmental pilot study was conducted through weekly home deliveries of noncaloric beverages to displace sugarsweetened beverages (SSBs) to reduce SSB consumption among adolescents, who were frequent consumers of SSB (23) . The results of this relatively simple environmental intervention showed that SSB intake decreased in the intervention group, and investigators saw a significant body mass index (BMI) change among adolescents in the highest BMI tertile group.\\nSocial-environmental influences within the home such as modeling of healthful dietary intake by parents and siblings, authoritative feeding style (i.e., high in limit setting but also high in nurturance), and more (18, 27, 44) and may be the strongest predictor of fruit and vegetable consumption among young children (18) . A recent systematic review by van der Horst and colleagues (100) report an association between parent and child intake of fat, fruits, vegetables, and soft drinks.\\nAnother factor that may influence children's dietary intake is parental feeding style and parenting practices. An authoritative feeding style has been positively associated with preschool children's intake of dairy and vegetables (73) , and mother's authoritative parenting style is associated with adolescent intake of fruits and vegetables (63) . Birch (5) found that parental practices such as restricting foods, pressuring children to eat, or using foods as rewards may inadvertently promote behaviors counter to their intentions.

Thus, there is substantial evidence that the influences of these practice effects had unfortunate consequences, as a confusing state evolved with claims and counterclaims made for the \"benefits\" of one antipsychotic or another. It is our hope that by drawing attention to this issue, the field will begin to develop novel strategies that may overcome changes in cognitive performance that are solely due to practice effects. An organized attempt to reduce practice effects will not only eliminate a large source of noise in AD trials but also reduce the likelihood of misinterpreting outcomes. As such, we believe that this issue should be dealt with proactively in the design of clinical trials.\\nCritically, given our review of the literature, it is likely that individuals who are at high risk for AD (symptomatic or asymptomatic) and who are enrolled in trials and have intact cognition or subtly impaired cognition will demonstrate robust practice effects on many of the tests used. If not controlled, these practice effects may mask subtle decline in a placebo group, reducing the ability to detect improvements, if any, in the active treatment group. In this latter group, conservatively, an ES of 0.25 units would likely be larger than decline over a 6-to12-month period. Alternatively, effects might be misinterpreted as active drug effects in trials in which cohort differences in learning were present and positive drug effects would have to be substantial to be detected (see below). Several solutions to the problem of practice effects can be considered (Table 2) . On the face of it, the use of alternate forms would seem to be a straightforward approach [30] .

Three layers of convolution with three pooling layers followed by two fully-connected layers were utilized in MCADNNet topology (https://github.com/samansarraf/MCADNNet). Finally, a softmax layer to classify three classes was added to the end of the network. Three convolutional layers were designed to extract deep but hierarchical features from data. Figure 1 images the MCADNNet architecture. In this topology design, functional and structural MRI samples were upsampled to 5656 pixels, the closest dimension to the original image size after data conversion. The upsampled images were fed into the first convolution layer that contains 10 filters of 55. In the second layer, the first max pooling layer downsampled the data by a factor of two. Next, in the third layer that is the second convolution layer, the features were passed through 20 filters of 55. As we will see later, the first Conv. layer extracted high-level features. After, the second max pooling layer downsampled the outcome of the second conv. layer which were mid-level features by a factor of two. The final convolution layer (the 5th layer) generated the low-level features to feed the last pooling layer. Two consecutive fully-connected layers were learned from the hierarchical features and transferred the output to the softmax layer for multiclass classification. Increasing the number of convolutional layers as well as the number of filters generated a higher number of network parameters. To avoid any potential overfitting or extraction of various features from the data, the pooling layers were utilized, which also accelerated the training process.As described earlier, DeepAD and MCADNNet were trained from scratch using ADNI</td>\n",

However, there is no significant correlation between time under review and the paper's IDR score, and the IDR score does not predict time under review. Confidence in this finding is buttressed by an analysis of data on unpublished working papers that we collected from www.ArXiv.org. We searched for working papers by the 854 authors in our sample, and were able to locate 220 papers written by 63 authors (see Table A4). Stripping all references from these working papers, identifying each referenced journal, and matching the journals with WoS SCs allowed us to calculate IDR scores for each working paper. Comparisons of the 220 working papers with the 3983 published papers by the same authors reveal that working papers are, indeed, more interdisciplinary, and this may make them more likely to be file-drawered or rejected, thereby contributing to the productivity penalty. But because working papers are more recent (average posting date in ArXiv.org is 2009, compared to an average publication date of 1997 for the published papers), and may be more interdisciplinary simply given the upward trend in IDR (documented by Porter and Rafols 2012, and confirmed with our data in Figure 3), it is difficult to interpret this difference. As a more stringent test, we took a closer look at our sample of working papers. For each working paper, we identified which papers were subsequently published (using author updates on www.ArXiv.org and online searches for each paper). We compared working papers that eventually got published with those that did not. Here, the eventually published papers (n=122) are actually more interdisciplinary than the still unpublished papers (n=115), a difference significant at p=.054 (two-tailed), suggesting that IDR papers are not hindered in the review process. ~ Table A4 and Figure 3 about here ~ Taken together, these supplementary data and analyses support our theorizing about cognitive and collaborative challenges</td>\n",

For example, under a broad set of simulated conditions, Miller et al. (2011) found that when false positive detections occurred only 1% of the time, the standard occupancy estimator (MacKenzie et al. 2006) was positively biased by an average of 0.06 (and up to 0.29) . This bias becomes even more severe with higher false positive detection probabilities. Using field data from pickerel frog (Lithobates palustris) call surveys, Miller et al. (2011) found that occupancy estimates were 2.15 times greater when false positive detections were not accounted for. Biases that result from false positive errors are greatest when species are rare (Miller et al. 2011) . The costs associated with inaccurate inference owing to these errors can be substantial (Dalton 2009 , Roberts et al. 2010 Many important insights about auditory surveys have come from recent studies using an automatic playback system that enables field conditions to be simulated, originally developed by Simons et al. (2007) . These studies have extended our understanding of the detection process and the validity of statistical estimators that attempt to account for imperfect detection (Simons et al. 2007 , Alldredge et al. 2008 , McClintock et al. 2010a among others) . A key finding of these studies, as well as others (e.g., Bart 1985 , Genet and Sargent 2003 , Lotz and Allen 2007 , Campbell and Francis 2011 , Farmer et al. 2012 , is that false positive errors are more common than generally acknowledged. McClintock et al. (2010a, b) was the first to examine false positive detections in detail.

Therefore, a segmentation algorithm with the ability to adapt to different protocols is very desirable.\\nBased on the previous considerations, in this paper we present a novel and fully automated hippocampal segmentation algorithm, named HUMAN (Hippocampal Unified Multi-AtlasNetworks), which combines in a unified framework the accuracy of multi-atlas methods with the robustness of artificial neural networks classification. The performance of this methodology was assessed with two independent test sets, segmented with two independent protocols. The first set was provided by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the second one by the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS). Different manifold strategies for atlas selection were explored in order to identify an optimal setup for learning. The performance of HUMAN when applied to sub-regions ( patches) of the hippocampus was then investigated. Finally, HUMAN was compared to the publicly available segmentation tool FreeSurfer (Fischl 2012) and to a basic multi-atlas pipeline, consisting of registration and label fusion. A data set of 100 T1 MRI scans from the ADNI database (1.5 T and 3.0 T), including normal control (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects, was used in preparation of this article.

In MCI group, the average MMSE decline is 9.2 (within 23 years), which indicates a substantial neuropsychological disorder has been developed. Therefore, the corresponding decrease of the cortical thickness is expected. In NC group, the average MMSE change is 1.3. Considering the possible MMSE assessment errors, subjects in this group can be regarded as neuropsychological healthy, and thus the cortical thickness is expected to keep stable (or slight decrease with normal aging). Since the 4D processing is introduced at both the segmentation step and the thickness measuring step, totally four different thickness measuring pipelines are compared in order to trace the source of the possible observed improvements. The four different combinations are: 3D segmentation and 3D thickness measurement (3S3T), 3D segmentation and 4D thickness measurement (3S4T), 4D segmentation and 3D thickness measurement (4S3T) and 4D segmentation and 4D thickness measurement (4S4T). After the 4 different thickness values are measured, in order to conduct voxel-wise group analysis, each subject's thickness maps are mapped onto the template space. Results on MCI group. Before the voxel-wise correlation analysis can be conducted in the template space, the mapped thickness is first smoothed using full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian filter ( = 8mm) in order to suppress possible registration errors and inter-subject structure variations. After that, Pearson's correlation between thickness and MMSE score is calculated voxel-wise within each subject. The average correlation within the MCI group are then computed by transforming the correlation coefficients to Fisher's z -value and transforming back. The resultant average correlations from the four methods are summarized in Fig. 3 . As we can see, when more 4D</td>\n",

Furthermore, there are two species of eelgrass that thrive in Willapa Bay, each with a unique signature. North American eelgrass (Zostera Marina) is larger leafed than Asian eelgrass (Zostera Japonica) and tends to occupy the inter-tidal zone (Backman, 1991;Phillips, 1984). The lighter hue of Asian eelgrass could easily be detected on the tidal flats, but could not be clearly distinguished from North American eelgrass in the inter-tidal zone. The combination of the two eelgrass species in the inter-tidal zone provided a unique spectral signature of its own, leading to three different signatures of eelgrass. There were other unidentifiable spectral signatures for which no source could be located. Several regions in the northern end of the study area had received sediment deposition following the flight mission and consequently no source for reflectance could be determined. The use of preliminary data gathered to measure spectral signatures was critical for the accurate interpretation of the Willapa Bay eelgrass photo set and will prove to be an integral component to future eelgrass distribution studies in Willapa Bay. Determining the size of the minimum mapping unit for this study proved to be problematic due to the presence of a non-native rush, Spartina spp., throughout Willapa Bay. C-CAP guidelines suggest that a minimum mapping unit of .03 hectares on the ground is appropriate for SRV distribution studies under ideal conditions. However, the prolific growth of Spartina spp., throughout Willapa Bay created a situation where countless island polygons of Spartina spp., clones would need to be excluded from eelgrass beds if the .03 hectare minimum mapping unit was used. To avoid mapping Spartina spp. rather than eelgrass, the minimum mapping unit size was increased to 1/10\" or 2.54 millimeters on the   \n",

Total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) in Moses Lake and Bayou for dioxin in edible tissue and PCBs in edible tissue are planned. Additional data is being collected before a management strategy is selected for the bacteria impairment.\\nThere are two major tidal inlets into Corpus Christi Bay. Aransas Pass (Corpus Christi Ship Channel), between Mustang Island and San Jose Island, which accounts for the majority of the tidal exchange between the bay and the Gulf of Mexico. Packery Channel, between the southwestern end of Mustang Island and North Padre Island, is manmade inlet that supplies a lesser amount of the bay's tidal exchange. Overall, the natural depth of the bay is relatively shallow, with an average depth of approximately 9 feet. Tides in Corpus Christi Bay under normal conditions are very small in amplitude, usually less than 3 feet between low and high tide. Wind speed and direction within Corpus Christi Bay plays an important role in affecting tide elevation. It can dampen or enhance the height of waves as well as their potential energy. Prevailing winds are from the southeast, with occasional strong northerly winds that are associated with passing cold fronts. Winds combined with seasonal tide events can greatly exacerbate the tidal range as well as move the range up or down by 1 or 2 feet. Storm tides during Category 4 or 5 hurricanes could be as high as 15-20 feet above normal water levels according to NOAA's Sea, Lake, and Overland Surge from Hurricanes (SLOSH) Model. The project site is located along Indian Point in Upper Corpus Christi Bay. Indian Point is a small peninsula that extends from the northeastern shore and extends towards Rincon Point on the southwestern shore. The two peninsulas separate Nueces Bay from Upper Corpus Christi Bay. Conditions within project area are primarily influenced by Corpus Christi Bay. The hydrology of the area is affected   \n",

While this fitting method deviates from recommendations by KZ07 regarding how the fit should be performed (i.e., observations should be binned and then fit), the focus here is on interagency and interannual differences rather than the absolute accuracy of any one formula. Such an analysis shows how operational procedures might have changed over time. The WPR parameters are shown in Fig. 3 as a time series along with the root-mean-square (RMS) error of the empirical fit and V 920, the wind speed corresponding to MCP 5 920 hPa. The RMS values provide insights into how much an agency followed any WPR. For instance, AR ended in 1987, thus forcing agencies to estimate intensity from satellites more often, as is done in Dvorak (1984) . The result is that after 1987, the maximum RMS is small (about 6 kt) because both wind and pressure were derived from the same satellite estimate. Conversely, RMS values in the early record (e.g., before 1970) show RMS values exceeding 15 kt, implying a consistent WPR was not routinely used to constrain wind to pressure or vice versa. It is of note that the RMS rarely shows a step change in any time series. The RMSs for TD-9635 and CMA gradually drift from more than 10 kt to near 5 kt in the 1980s. An exception is the JTWC switch to a different WPR in 2007.\\nThe impact of any change in procedures can be seen in the V 920 time series (Fig. 3, bottom) . Given the small bias compared to AR pressure data, any change in this value implies that there is likely a temporal bias in the reported wind speeds that could preclude climatic analysis (i.e., direct comparisons between years with vastly different V 920 ). The CMA and TD-9635 show a drift from 140-160 kt in the early record to 120 kt in the 1970s. It is likely a change in operational practice caused this gradual change. Given the previous validation of MCP from CMA (cf. Fig. 2) , it is possible that winds for CMA before 1970 are    \n",

The concept of a CSA program is grounded in linking consumers to their food source and farmers. As a result, CSA programs sometimes require members to \"volunteer\" on the farm. Some volunteers might help with the planting, others with weeding during the growing season and others with the harvest. Approximately 15% of the CSA farms in our sample required members to work on the farm a mandatory number of hours. Proposition 1 predicts that the price difference between yield shares and weight shares will be determined by two potentially competing factors, the yield premium and the risk premium.\\nGiven the anecdotal evidence discussed above, we expect that the yield premium will be near zero (though this is not testable directly in our data set) and that the risk premium will be positive (weight shares cost more) due to negative covariance of prices and yields. We conduct a regression analysis to test the resulting prediction that weight shares will be more costly, on average, and to estimate the extra cost under the assumption that the yield premium is zero.\\nSpecifically, we model the price of a share as a function of the share type while controlling for other factors that affect share price, including the products produced by the farm and offered through the CSA program, the farming practices, the pick-up location, the state where the CSA farm is located, and other outlets through which the farm sells its products. We estimate the following equation using ordinary least squares (OLS). Our econometric model is a basic hedonic pricing approach. Firm-level data, in this case the prices charged by the CSA farms, can only be used to estimate hedonic models if price-cost markups are first eliminated and the competitiveness of the market is   \n",

Aggregate pre-test scores and mean SES were treated as global school characteristics because these variables must be controlled to assess the effects of Catholic schools. Internal school characteristics were included to understand the reasons for any effects of Catholic schools. Examining internal characteristics can also help us determine the kind of school policy or environment that can positively or negatively affect students' academic development. The internal school variables were monitoring of academic progress, strictness of school rules, extent of school's encouragement for parental support and involvement, teachers' morale, students' morale, and teacher-student ratios. See Appendix A for the list of all the variables and their coding schemes. We began the analysis by generating descriptive statistics such as means, standard deviations, and correlations. Table 1 presents the means and standard deviations of variables included in HLM analysis, as well as the correlation coefficients between the variables and Catholic schools.

A further limitation of the present work is the significantly younger age of the control group in comparison to the patient cohort. However, this aspect might only have contributed to the discrimination between dementia patients and control subjects but not to the high classification accuracy of AD and FTLD patients as these were very similar in their age range. If age contributed to the classification accuracy there should be lower classification accuracy for young dementia patients and older control subjects as they did not differ in age. For comparison of both types of dementia patients and control subjects the classification accuracy did not differ for younger and older dementia patients although half of the patients were in the same age range as the control group. In AD group all patients were classified correctly. In FTLD group one younger and one older patient were misclassified. Independently of age, all control subjects were classified correctly for both comparisons. These results indicate that the slight mean age differences is not the decisive factor for the high discrimination accuracy using combined information from FDG-PET and MRI. Furthermore, if age still slightly contributed to the high discrimination of dementia patients and control subjects this contribution was also present in all other single modality and multimodal whole-brain and ROI-based SVM classifications applied in this study. Therefore, age cannot account for increased differentiation accuracies when combined ROI information from FDG-PET and MRI are used for differentiation of dementia patients and control subjects.\\nAnother point is that subjects in the control group in our study reported subjective cognitive complaints which might have limited the interpretation of the results of our study. However, only subjects were included whose cognitive complaints were not confirmed by comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation. The CDR is a semi-structural interview and   \n",

The maximum depth of descent was assumed to be the greatest depth in the water temperature profile where the minimum temperatures reported by the tag and those of the water temperature profile were the same. For the track with multiple home range cores (Shark 5), movement patterns were categorised as within and outside the 25% utilisation distribution. We then used generalised linear models with a binomial distribution and a logit link function to assess the relationship between the probability of the shark being in a home range core and water temperature, bathymetry and region of the WA coast (north-latitude < 24S and south-latitude >24S). We were not able to fit all three explanatory variables in one model as there was no overlap of the temperature ranges between the two regions. Consequently, we fitted a model to examine the probability of being in a home range core in relation to bathymetry and region and two separate models (using the data from north and south coasts, respectively) to examine the probability of the shark being in a home range core in relation to sea surface temperature. To address the autocorrelation present in the data we used a matched-block bootstrap sampling for all models with replacement procedure [71, 72] that resampled blocks of data randomly and then recombined them in a random order, creating a bootstrapped dataset that minimized the effect of autocorrelation [71] [72] [73] .

Finally, we show that the average hippocampal intensity after RAVEL correction performs better than intensity-normalized-only images in discriminating between AD patients and healthy controls, and between MCI patients and healthy controls. This shows that RAVEL-corrected T1-w intensities are more biologically meaningful than intensity-normalized-only images for group comparisons, and therefore potentially promising for the development of biomarkers.\\nAlthough we apply RAVEL in the context of T1-w MRI of the brain, our method is generalizable to many imaging modalities. In addition, the flexibility in the choice of the control voxels makes RAVEL applicable to any disease or pathology.

Approximately 4500 people live within the boundary of this watershed (Figure 1 ). The Pages Creek watershed consists mostly of residential neighborhoods and some commercial development.

Our analysis of historical hydrographic data has shown the mean position of the SACCF to be much further east than in other work; this makes fluctuations in the western extent of the front much more important in terms of delivering krill into regions accessible by the predators. Eddies shed from the front may also transport krill into the region, thus the timing and frequency of these events and the fate of the eddies may have an impact on the South Georgia ecosystem. The resolution of the close proximity of the SACCF to the southern shelf of South Georgia shows that the SACCF may play an important role in transport to the southern South Georgia region. Once material reaches the South Georgia shelf, on-shelf processes such as tides may act to retain or circulate it on-shelf. These processes could provide an alternative transport route for passive drifters to reach the western end of South Georgia. Finally, a note on the dynamics of the system. The short period of model output, with only two occurrences of the large westward shift in the position of the retroflection, means that we cannot definitively determine the mechanisms for the westward extensions of the SACCF and the related eddy-shedding. However, the wind forcing in the run of OCCAM considered here is the only forcing that is not cyclical (recall that surface temperature and salinity are relaxed to monthly climatological Levitus 1994 data, Section 3.1). The infrequency of the large extensions of the SACCF retroflection suggests that there might be a signal in the wind stress that predisposes the front to move zonally. Time series of the mean zonal and meridional wind stress averaged over the Scotia Sea (50 -65jS, 70 -30jW) and over the study region, however, show no consistent feature that corresponds to the westward extensions of the SACCF. This suggests that wind stress does not play a direct role in triggering the mov   \n",

Normal elderly controls had a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 24 or higher [45] , a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) of 0 [46] , and no diagnosis of neurological disease or psychiatric disorder. MCI patients had a MMSE score of 24 or higher, a subjective memory complaint, objective memory loss measured by education adjusted scores on the Wechsler Memory Scale Logical Memory II, a CDR score of 0.5, absence of significant levels of impairment in other cognitive domains, preserved activities of daily living (ADLs), and an absence of dementia [47] . Participants with mild AD were enrolled if they had a MMSE score between 20 and 26 (inclusive), a CDR score of 0.5 or 1.0, and met NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable AD [48] .\\nAt the initiation of our study, 489 ADNI   \n",

A recent home-based environmental pilot study was conducted through weekly home deliveries of noncaloric beverages to displace sugarsweetened beverages (SSBs) to reduce SSB consumption among adolescents, who were frequent consumers of SSB (23) . The results of this relatively simple environmental intervention showed that SSB intake decreased in the intervention group, and investigators saw a significant body mass index (BMI) change among adolescents in the highest BMI tertile group.\\nSocial-environmental influences within the home such as modeling of healthful dietary intake by parents and siblings, authoritative feeding style (i.e., high in limit setting but also high in nurturance), and more (18, 27, 44) and may be the strongest predictor of fruit and vegetable consumption among young children (18) . A recent systematic review by van der Horst and colleagues (100) report an association between parent and child intake of fat, fruits, vegetables, and soft drinks.\\nAnother factor that may influence children's dietary intake is parental feeding style and parenting practices. An authoritative feeding style has been positively associated with preschool children's intake of dairy and vegetables (73) , and mother's authoritative parenting style is associated with adolescent intake of fruits and vegetables (63) . Birch (5) found that parental practices such as restricting foods, pressuring children to eat, or using foods as rewards may inadvertently promote behaviors counter to their intentions. For example, parental pressure could result in decreased preference for certain foods, whereas food restriction could increase preferences for certain foods.\\nFrequency of family meals may also have a positive impact   \n",

Thus, there is substantial evidence that the influences of these practice effects had unfortunate consequences, as a confusing state evolved with claims and counterclaims made for the \"benefits\" of one antipsychotic or another. It is our hope that by drawing attention to this issue, the field will begin to develop novel strategies that may overcome changes in cognitive performance that are solely due to practice effects. An organized attempt to reduce practice effects will not only eliminate a large source of noise in AD trials but also reduce the likelihood of misinterpreting outcomes. As such, we believe that this issue should be dealt with proactively in the design of clinical trials.\\nCritically, given our review of the literature, it is likely that individuals who are at high risk for AD (symptomatic or asymptomatic) and who are enrolled in trials and have intact cognition or subtly impaired cognition will demonstrate robust practice effects on many of the tests used. If not controlled, these practice effects may mask subtle decline in a placebo group, reducing the ability to detect improvements, if any, in the active treatment group. In this latter group, conservatively, an ES of 0.25 units would likely be larger than decline over a 6-to12-month period. Alternatively, effects might be misinterpreted as active drug effects in trials in which cohort differences in learning were present and positive drug effects would have to be substantial to be detected (see below). Several solutions to the problem of practice effects can be considered (Table 2) . On the face of it, the use of alternate forms would seem to be a straightforward approach [30] .

Three layers of convolution with three pooling layers followed by two fully-connected layers were utilized in MCADNNet topology (https://github.com/samansarraf/MCADNNet). Finally, a softmax layer to classify three classes was added to the end of the network. Three convolutional layers were designed to extract deep but hierarchical features from data. Figure 1 images the MCADNNet architecture. In this topology design, functional and structural MRI samples were upsampled to 5656 pixels, the closest dimension to the original image size after data conversion. The upsampled images were fed into the first convolution layer that contains 10 filters of 55. In the second layer, the first max pooling layer downsampled the data by a factor of two. Next, in the third layer that is the second convolution layer, the features were passed through 20 filters of 55. As we will see later, the first Conv. layer extracted high-level features. After, the second max pooling layer downsampled the outcome of the second conv. layer which were mid-level features by a factor of two. The final convolution layer (the 5th layer) generated the low-level features to feed the last pooling layer. Two consecutive fully-connected layers were learned from the hierarchical features and transferred the output to the softmax layer for multiclass classification. Increasing the number of convolutional layers as well as the number of filters generated a higher number of network parameters. To avoid any potential overfitting or extraction of various features from the data, the pooling layers were utilized, which also accelerated the training process.As described earlier, DeepAD and MCADNNet were trained from scratch using ADNI   \n",

However, there is no significant correlation between time under review and the paper's IDR score, and the IDR score does not predict time under review. Confidence in this finding is buttressed by an analysis of data on unpublished working papers that we collected from www.ArXiv.org. We searched for working papers by the 854 authors in our sample, and were able to locate 220 papers written by 63 authors (see Table A4). Stripping all references from these working papers, identifying each referenced journal, and matching the journals with WoS SCs allowed us to calculate IDR scores for each working paper. Comparisons of the 220 working papers with the 3983 published papers by the same authors reveal that working papers are, indeed, more interdisciplinary, and this may make them more likely to be file-drawered or rejected, thereby contributing to the productivity penalty. But because working papers are more recent (average posting date in ArXiv.org is 2009, compared to an average publication date of 1997 for the published papers), and may be more interdisciplinary simply given the upward trend in IDR (documented by Porter and Rafols 2012, and confirmed with our data in Figure 3), it is difficult to interpret this difference. As a more stringent test, we took a closer look at our sample of working papers. For each working paper, we identified which papers were subsequently published (using author updates on www.ArXiv.org and online searches for each paper). We compared working papers that eventually got published with those that did not. Here, the eventually published papers (n=122) are actually more interdisciplinary than the still unpublished papers (n=115), a difference significant at p=.054 (two-tailed), suggesting that IDR papers are not hindered in the review process. ~ Table A4 and Figure 3 about here ~ Taken together, these supplementary data and analyses support our theorizing about cognitive and collaborative challenges    \n",

For example, under a broad set of simulated conditions, Miller et al. (2011) found that when false positive detections occurred only 1% of the time, the standard occupancy estimator (MacKenzie et al. 2006) was positively biased by an average of 0.06 (and up to 0.29) . This bias becomes even more severe with higher false positive detection probabilities. Using field data from pickerel frog (Lithobates palustris) call surveys, Miller et al. (2011) found that occupancy estimates were 2.15 times greater when false positive detections were not accounted for. Biases that result from false positive errors are greatest when species are rare (Miller et al. 2011) . The costs associated with inaccurate inference owing to these errors can be substantial (Dalton 2009 , Roberts et al. 2010 Many important insights about auditory surveys have come from recent studies using an automatic playback system that enables field conditions to be simulated, originally developed by Simons et al. (2007) . These studies have extended our understanding of the detection process and the validity of statistical estimators that attempt to account for imperfect detection (Simons et al. 2007 , Alldredge et al. 2008 , McClintock et al. 2010a among others) . A key finding of these studies, as well as others (e.g., Bart 1985 , Genet and Sargent 2003 , Lotz and Allen 2007 , Campbell and Francis 2011 , Farmer et al. 2012 , is that false positive errors are more common than generally acknowledged. McClintock et al. (2010a, b) was the first to examine false positive detections in detail.

Also, when dealing specifically with hippocampal segmentation the differences in segmentation protocols represent a particularly limiting constraint (Bellotti and Pascazio 2012 , Nestor et al 2013 . Although in recent years a considerable effort has been invested in the creation of a unified segmentation protocol (Frisoni and Jack 2011, Frisoni et al 2015) , consensus has not been reached. Therefore, a segmentation algorithm with the ability to adapt to different protocols is very desirable.\\nBased on the previous considerations, in this paper we present a novel and fully automated hippocampal segmentation algorithm, named HUMAN (Hippocampal Unified Multi-AtlasNetworks), which combines in a unified framework the accuracy of multi-atlas methods with the robustness of artificial neural networks classification. The performance of this methodology was assessed with two independent test sets, segmented with two independent protocols. The first set was provided by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the second one by the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS). Different manifold strategies for atlas selection were explored in order to identify an optimal setup for learning. The performance of HUMAN when applied to sub-regions ( patches) of the hippocampus was then investigated. Finally, HUMAN was compared to the publicly available segmentation tool FreeSurfer (Fischl 2012) and to a basic multi-atlas pipeline, consisting of registration and label fusion. A data set of 100 T1 MRI scans from the ADNI database (1.5 T and 3.0 T), including normal control (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects, was used in preparation of this article.

In our study, 40 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who later developed to probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) and, for comparison, 15 normal controls (NC) were selected. In MCI group, the average MMSE decline is 9.2 (within 23 years), which indicates a substantial neuropsychological disorder has been developed. Therefore, the corresponding decrease of the cortical thickness is expected. In NC group, the average MMSE change is 1.3. Considering the possible MMSE assessment errors, subjects in this group can be regarded as neuropsychological healthy, and thus the cortical thickness is expected to keep stable (or slight decrease with normal aging). Since the 4D processing is introduced at both the segmentation step and the thickness measuring step, totally four different thickness measuring pipelines are compared in order to trace the source of the possible observed improvements. The four different combinations are: 3D segmentation and 3D thickness measurement (3S3T), 3D segmentation and 4D thickness measurement (3S4T), 4D segmentation and 3D thickness measurement (4S3T) and 4D segmentation and 4D thickness measurement (4S4T). After the 4 different thickness values are measured, in order to conduct voxel-wise group analysis, each subject's thickness maps are mapped onto the template space. Results on MCI group. Before the voxel-wise correlation analysis can be conducted in the template space, the mapped thickness is first smoothed using full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian filter ( = 8mm) in order to suppress possible registration errors and inter-subject structure variations. After that, Pearson's correlation between thickness and MMSE score is calculated voxel-wise within each subject. The average correlation within the MCI group are then computed by transforming the correlation coefficients to Fisher's z -value and transforming back. The resultant average correlations from the four methods are summarized in Fig. 3 . As we can see, when more 4D    \n",

A large proportion of research funding in US universities and certainly the most prestigious are from national institutes such as NSF and NIH. The level of US research expenditures is thus related direct US government policy and indirectly through R and D tax credits (Bloom, Griffith et al. 2002). Consequently, individuals mostly funded by research grants, fellowships and research assistantships are not only likely to develop better research skills, there are more likely to become embedded in higher quality research network. Thus: H4: Individuals whose primary source of funding for their degree focus on research training and activities are more likely to be embedded in higher quality research networks and less likely to return home, all else equal. Individuals often forego economic benefits for cultural and familial reasons. Thus we expect the extent to which individuals are socially and culturally connect to their home countries it is likely to increase their likelihood of returning home. While simple to state this is very complex. It can include such diverse issues as social constructed gender roles, family demographics (e.g. marital status), and connection to social networks through prior institutional affiliations (e.g. number of prior higher education degrees from their home country). Empirical efforts to deal with these factor are typically done through the use of numerous control variables like gender, marital status, number of higher education degrees from their home country, and country specific effects.
